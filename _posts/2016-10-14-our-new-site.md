This weekend, we're sponsoring [Taco Takedown](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/my-athens-terrapin-present-taco-takedown-tickets-27139034583) in partnership with [MyAthens](http://myathensis.com/). We figured, in that case, we should probably have a website up.

We've been so busy over the past year (hard to believe it's been a year) that up until now, we've only had a Squarespace landing page up. We felt that it was time to make some updates and have a site that better reflects Roundtable Development.

We'll have some project post-mortems, technical blogs, and Athens tech community news, and we'd love to chat with y'all. Right now, you can find us most conveniently on Twitter: [@roundtabledev42](http://twitter.com/roundtabledev42).

May the Force be with you!
