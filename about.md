## Our Mission

Our mission is to solve business problems using software.  Sometimes that means building custom software.  Other times it means simply using off the shelf software to improve processes.  That’s why we’re consultants first and programmers second.  

We’ve run companies with overbuilt software products and budget overruns, and we understand that pain.  We’ve designed our process to understand your business first, so that we can recommend practical, effective solutions.  

## Our Team

We’re a small team, with a diverse set of industry backgrounds.  From education to health care, and a multitude of industries in between, chances are we’ve worked on a project in your field. We’re founders of startup companies, teachers, software developers, literature nerds, coffee masters, and scotch salesmen.

We use our experience to develop practical solutions to your business problems.
